                    <p><strong>OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMER: The information below is (somewhat) accurate as of the 2025-26 year. The content, difficulty, and structure of these courses are subject to change based on the coordinator.</strong></p>

                    <p>As of writing this in January 2026, I have finished my first semester at the University of Toronto. Looking back now, it's hardly more than a blur, even if it was only a month or so ago. What I do vividly remember is that the fall semester was, as I had expected, a tough, different, and often humbling experience. Knowing that I survived it, I think I can take on whatever challenge I will encounter next (I'll come back to this later in a couple of years and see if that statement still holds up).</p>

                    <p>So, in accordance with the core mission of this site, I'm writing a guide to the fall semester engineering courses with the hope that I can impart some wisdom on succeeding in these classes. For each course, I will start with an introduction to the material, how grades are assessed, a bit about my experience, and my tips on surviving it. Please keep in mind that my experience/opinions are not universal, and you need to consider what is best for you personally to succeed academically.</p>

                    <h3>overview</h3>
                    <p>This course is designed to help you transition into your first-year of studies, understand the field of engineering, and develop academic and professional skills. You'll learn and apply techniques in time-management, problem-solving, communication, effective learning, engineering ethics, resume-writing, and more through lectures and assignments. Grades are based on a series of modules, written assignments, attendance in tutorials, and a final test. This is a high pass/pass/fail course and does not contribute to your overall CGPA.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Many of my classmates treated this course like it was unnecessary--though I'd have to disagree. I didn't always attend lectures and tutorials when there were other matters I had to prioritise, but I found the stories, lessons, and advice I got from them to be incredibly helpful and insightful. The assignments were often tedious but not particularly difficult; please make sure you complete and submit them on time.</p>
                    
                    <p>The final test--which was scheduled ahead of finals period--consisted of a multiple choice and written section. Both parts were straightforward and easy, but it was longer than expected and I had trouble with questions that required information from lectures I skipped. I finished this course with a High Pass (+80%).</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to attend most of the lectures/tutorials and complete all assignments to pass, but it's not necessary to put more effort into this course beyond that (especially when you have 5 other courses).</li>
                        <li>Get to know your TA; these are upper-year students who've been in your shoes before and have plenty of insights on how make the best of your experience here.</li>
                        <li>Using past tests to study for the final may not be helpful, as they change the content of the test and the course material every year. I recommend going over lecture slides and using the study guide they will provide you.</li>

                    <h3>overview</h3>
                    <p>You will find that many of the concepts taught in this course are a continuation or repeat of what you learned in high school chemistry, with the addition of materials science. The first half of APS110 focuses on the behaviours and properties of materials (i.e. strain and stress, lattices and structures, imperfections, optics) whereas the second half covers chemistry concepts (i.e. electron configuration, thermodynamics, reaction rates, equilibrium). This course involves completing the online textbook questions, a couple of problem sets, online quizzes, one term test, and a final exam.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">thoughts</h3>
                    <p>APS110 is often regarded as one of the easiest and most enjoyable of the first-year courses. The (amazing) textbook was written by the (amazing) coordinator, Scott Ramsay, and contains diagrams, lecture videos, and practice problems that cover everything you need to know for this class. The textbook problems are mandatory and count for about 5% of your grade--they're basically free marks since you get credit just for attempting them.</p>
                    
                    <p>I found the materials science portion more challenging than the chemistry review, mainly because it was entirely new content. The chemistry half felt more familiar, though the questions were definitely more involved than what I saw in high school. The term test was fair and closely reflected the practice problems, though I wish I'd spent more time on past exams beforehand. I finished with a B-.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write down important equations and indicate when and how to use them.</li>
                        <li>Do the textbook problems--they're a free 5% and help you understand the content. But when it comes to exam prep, focus more on the assignments, quizzes, and past exams since those better reflect the question style and difficulty.</li>
                        <li>Start studying early. There's a lot of content to cover and it's easy to fall behind if you cram everything last minute.</li>

                    <h3>overview</h3>
                    <p>ESP I is built around three pillars: Design, Communication, and Teamwork. You'll work through a semester-long design project with a randomly assigned team, producing deliverables like a Team Charter, Project Requirements document, and a Conceptual Design Specification. Individual assessments include an Engineering Observation, Problem Statement Quiz, Teamwork Analysis, Performance Review, and a final exam. The course is graded 60% individually and 40% as a team.</p>
                    
                    <p>In October, you'll be placed into a team of about five or six people to work on a design project. You won't have direct contact with your client this semester--that comes in APS112. The goal is to produce a conceptual design while learning the formal design process and developing your communication and teamwork skills.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">thoughts</h3>
                    <p>This course is a learning curve. Many people struggle early on, but you can make a comeback if you put in the effort. The design project might not be exciting--most people feel the same way--but it's the process you're learning that matters.</p>
                    
                    <p>Group dynamics can make or break your experience. I unfortunately did not have a great team, as two of my teammates consistently failed to pull their weight. Your TA and CI (Communication Instructor) will have significant influence on your grade, and marking can vary drastically between sections. Some TAs are strict about following the reference handbook, others focus more on creativity and effort.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are some easy marks to grab: PD (Professional Development) points are worth 0.1% each and you earn them by attending events like Myfab Safety Training. The Performance Review grade is straightforward if you show up to tutorials and stay engaged.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you use every opportunity to earn the extra PD points!</li>
                        <li>You don't need to read the textbook thoroughly, though I recommend taking good notes for the most important concepts/methods to review before the exam.</li>
                        <li>Set internal deadlines for assignments at least two days before the actual due date. Then actually check the work after that internal deadline--this catches the most painful mistakes and shows you who might not be pulling their weight.</li>
                        <li>Follow the assignment reference handbook and self-assessment lists closely for the PR and CDS.</li>
                        <li>Marking varies between sections, so figure out what your TA/CI prioritizes early on by asking questions regularly.</li>
                        <li>If you have a bad group, communicate early and often. Document everything (e.g. Google Docs edit history, chat logs, meeting minutes, etc.) and don't be afraid to reach out to your TA or CI for help mediating issues before they spiral.</li>

                    <h3>overview</h3>
                    <p>This course covers statics and dynamics--basically, how forces and motion work on structures and objects. You'll work through concepts like free body diagrams, equilibrium, trusses, beams, friction, kinematics, and Newton's laws. Assessments include weekly assignments, quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">thoughts</h3>
                    <p>CIV100 has a reputation, and not always a good one. Some people love it, most are indifferent, and a fair number find it miserable. I fell somewhere between indifferent and miserable, to be honest. The content itself isn't terrible, but the workload and the way concepts build on each other can make it overwhelming if you fall behind. The midterm is notorious for crushing people's hopes and dreams, but do not be discouraged if you do poorly on it. They almost always "linearly adjust" or "curve" final grades.</p>
                    
                    <p>The weekly assignments take time--usually several hours--but they're your best resource for understanding the material. The exams often reuse questions from past years with slight variations, so doing old tests is critical for exam prep.</p>
                    
                    <p>I switched to the online equivalent of this course, APS160, which involves weekly quizzes that are 1% each rather than two quizzes that are 5% each. Otherwise, APS160 and CIV100 are basically the same. I think this is a great alternative for anyone who may have a long commute and/or wants more flexibility in their schedule.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The weekly quizzes for APS160 can be a pain, as the platform Mastering Engineering is so troublesome to deal with and you only have two chances to answer the questions. Despite that, you can always request a regrade from the TAs if you provide your work.</li>
                        <li>Weekly assignments are critical. They take a lot of time, but if you actually work through them yourself, you'll understand the content much better. Set aside a few hours each week to get them done without cramming.</li>
                        <li>Past exams are your best friend. The format doesn't change much year to year, and questions are often recycled or slightly modified.</li>
                        <li>If your professor isn't clicking for you, don't be afraid to use external resources. There are great YouTube channels and online tutorials that explain statics and dynamics concepts clearly.</li>

                    <h3>overview</h3>
                    <p>This course covers limits, continuity, derivatives, applications of derivatives, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Assessments include Pre-Class Essentials (short quizzes), two term tests, and a final exam. There's also a universal make-up test that can replace your lowest test grade if you write it.</p>
                    
                    <p>The course expects you to come to class prepared by completing readings and quizzes beforehand. Lectures are active--you'll work through problems during class rather than just copying notes. Tutorials (called discussion groups) involve working on assigned problems with a TA.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">thoughts</h3>
                    <p><em>Note: I took APS162 (the summer equivalent) instead of MAT186, so this section is based on what I've heard from classmates who took the fall course.</em></p>
                    
                    <p>A lot of people underestimate this course because they've seen the material in high school. However, in MAT186, the questions are harder, the pace is faster, and the depth of understanding required is significantly greater than what you needed for high school calculus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Many of my friends who took MAT186 struggled more than they expected. The Pre-Class Essentials are manageable, but if you don't take them seriously, you'll show up to lectures underprepared. The term tests are tough--even though the format is predictable, the questions require a solid grasp of fundamentals and the ability to think through problems you haven't seen before.</p>
                    
                    <p>From what I've heard, the final exam can be brutal, especially if you've fallen behind on fundamentals earlier in the semester. The course moves quickly and it's easy to get overwhelmed if you're not keeping up consistently.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A lot of people underestimate this course, but beware that this is a completely different ball game, so make sure that you understand the fundamentals.</li>
                        <li>Do the Pre-Class Essentials properly. They're only worth 10%, but they prepare you for lectures and help you stay on top of the material. Your lowest three are dropped, so don't waste that buffer on laziness.</li>
                        <li>Attend lectures and participate in the in-class problems. This is where you actually learn how to apply concepts, not just memorize them.</li>
                        <li>Practice problems are everything. Do the ones provided by the teaching team and the suggested textbook problems. Past exams are helpful, but only after you've mastered the basics.</li>
                        <li>If you're struggling, go to office hours or the homework club. Don't wait until the week before an exam to ask for help.</li>

The course uses standards-based grading for weekly WebWork assignments and tutorials, and there are five major assignments, two term tests, and a final exam.</p>
                    
                    <p>The grading scheme is designed to reward consistent effort. You get +30% of your grade from WebWork, tutorial quizzes, surveys, a lab assignment, and Pre-Class Essentials (with your six lowest PCE marks dropped). The final exam is worth 35%.</p>

                    <p>This course has a lot of "free marks" built into it--if you keep up with the weekly work, you're already sitting on approx. 30% of your grade before the exams. The catch is that linear algebra is conceptually difficult, and if you fall behind, it's incredibly hard to catch up.</p>
                    
                    <p>I found the early content (vectors, matrices, systems of equations) very difficult because I had never been exposed to the material before, and I did not bode well with my lecturer's teaching style. However once I switched lecture sections and we hit eigenvalues and vector spaces, I had a much better understanding of the content even as it got more abstract. The course moves fast, and each concept builds on the previous ones. If you don't fully understand one topic, the next one becomes exponentially harder.</p>
                    
                    <p>I stayed on top of the quizzes and PCEs, which saved my grade. The term tests were challenging but fair--if you understood the Pre-Class Essentials and assignments, you could do well. The final was also not terribly hard, but I lost a lot of marks because I forgot how to do a certain question.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The style and content of midterms can vary wildly depending on the professor, so past midterms may not be entirely reliable for studying.</li>
                        <li>The free marks (WebWork, tutorial quizzes, PCEs) are there to keep you engaged with the course. Don't skip them--they're a large portion of your grade and they force you to stay on top of the material.</li>
                        <li>If you have time over the summer, study ahead for this course. It's one of the hardest to catch up on if you fall behind, and getting a head start makes a huge difference.</li>
                        <li>For exam prep, focus on the Pre-Class Essentials and learning standards. Review the tutorial assignments and make sure you can do similar problems without looking at solutions.</li>
                        <li>Go to Prof. Shai Cohen's office hours if you're confused. The concepts are abstract, and I think Prof. Cohen is great at explaining things in a way that makes it click together.</li>

                    <p>First semester is hard. There's no way around it. You're adjusting to a new environment, new expectations, and a level of academic rigor that's likely  beyond what you experienced in high school. Some courses will click for you, others won't. Some professors will be great, others will suck.</p>
                    
                    <p>Try your best to stay consistent, ask for help when you need it, and don't compare yourself too harshly to others. Everyone struggles with something--it's just not always visible. If I could go back and give myself one piece of advice, it would be this: take the free marks seriously, don't compare myself to others, and build good study habits early before things get overwhelming.</p>
                    
                    <p>Good luck. You'll make it through.</p>
