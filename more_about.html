                    <p>If you're on this page, I presume it is because you want to learn more about me as a person/idea/philosophy/enigma/social experiment/etc. aside from my academic and career development. I don't know exactly how much or how little you wish to know, but I will lay everything I am willing to offer out here regardless.</p>

<p>I was raised and educated primarily in Richmond, BC, a municipality within the Metro Vancouver area that is best known for fishing, agriculture, and Chinese food. I did not have a particularly remarkable childhood, I think. I was surrounded by people who loved me-- and that is all I could ever ask for. One of those people is my father, who graduated with a BASc in Civil Engineering from UBC before the fall of the Soviet Union. My older sister, the smarter sibling, is currently studying Engineering Physics at the same institution. As a result, the clear path for me was to attend UofT out of spite (this is a joke, mostly). </p>

<p>I spent most of my life online, as is the case for the majority of kids in my generation. In the real world, I was quite lonely, isolated, and self-loathing due to bullying and ostracization, so staring at computers for hours at a time was my escape. Through the internet, I developed intense fixations on various topics, including the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. This </p>

<p>Both in-person and online, I have often been described as androgynous and tomboyish. This often follows with questions along the lines of "what are your pronouns?", "how do you identify?", or more brazenly "what genitals were you born with?". To be straight (or gay) with you, I prefer male pronouns when communicating online. If I know you in-person, you may refer to me however you like, given that it is not, say, a slur. Currently, I'm not sure what my gender is. I feel as though I make an equally terrible woman or man. Ultimately, my greatest wish is to be able to experience the world through different lenses and not be restricted by my mortal flesh. </p>

<p>I feel that now would be an appropriate time to talk about the things that make me "tick", per se. I enjoy almost all genres of music, particularly indie, rock, folk, hip-hop, R&B, J-pop, alt, country, musicals, game soundtracks, and "mainstream" pop. I will genuinely listen to anything--from horny millennial club music to Chinese folk music. If it matters, I sided with Kendrick Lamar in his beef with Drake, and I believe J. Cole was incredibly wise and humble to drop out of the race early on. My favourite musicals include Mean Girls, Hadestown, Hamilton, Dear Evan Hanson, and EPIC.</p>

<p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing and watching video games (The Last of Us, Red Dead Redemption 2, Resident Evil, the Sims 4, Bloons TD 6, indie titles), going on long walks, writing stories, organising things, making spreadsheets, web development, and reading. Since birth I've had a vivid imagination, and to this day my most beloved and frequent hobby is daydreaming about fictional characters and worlds I've made up in my mind. Speaking of, if you ever see me in person, please ask me about Dillon "Diomedes" Malik Owen. </p>

<p>When I inevitably die, I hope I will be remembered as a person who tried to make the world a little bit better. To quote my favourite high school teacher: "Don't aspire to be a great person, aspire to be a good one".
